# Algorithm implementations

Algorithm implementations in different languages. This isn't meant to be exhaustive.

|Algorithm   |Language   |Comments   |
|---|---|---|
|MergeSort   |Javascript   |   |
|QuickSort   |Python   |   |
|Graph Minimum Cut   |Clojure   |   |
|Graph Strong Components   |Scala   |Full immutable and tailrec implementation    |

## TODO
* Add testing for each algorithm
* Multiple strategies for each algorithm
* Cross language benchmarking
* Improve Scala SC implementation performance
