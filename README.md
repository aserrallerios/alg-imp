# Algorithm implementations

Algorithm implementations in different languages. This isn't meant to be exhaustive.

|Algorithm   |Language   |Comments   |
|---|---|---|
|MergeSort   |Javascript   |   |
|QuickSort   |Python   |   |
|Graph Minimum Cut   |Clojure   |   |
|Graph Strong Components   |Scala   |Full immutable and tailrec implementation    |
|Graph Shortest Path   |Go   |   |
|2-SUM in Range   |Ruby   |The typical 2-SUM problem given t and a list of integers (L) as input is to find all x∈L and y∈L such that x + y = t. This implementation tries to find all t such that x + y = t (with x!=y) and t∈[Range] given a range and a list of integers   |
|Median Maintenance   |Ruby   |   |

## TODO
* Add testing for each algorithm
* Multiple strategies for each algorithm
* Cross language benchmarking
* Improve Scala SC implementation performance
